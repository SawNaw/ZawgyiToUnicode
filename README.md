# ZawgyiToUnicode
Text and batch filename conversion between Zawgyi and Unicode-compliant Burmese fonts.

Credit to GitHub user mgthantzin for the converter code. This is his repo: https://github.com/mgthantzin/mmfont.Net/tree/master/mmfont.Net

I took the code, gave it some touchup, and added unit tests. Eventually this might grow into a Blazor app.
